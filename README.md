applying advance  CSS

## main point :
  - the best way to perform a basic reset using the universal selector.
  - set the project-wide font defenitions.
  - clip parts of elements using clip-path.

  -----

  we add the font proprtyes in bady selector not in the universal selector because the font's proprtyes are inheritance for all childes 

  the line height means in the font style that property specifies the height of a line.

  adding layer in the background using background-image with two proprtyes first one is liner-gradient which tack three parameters the position and the first color and the second color, and the next one is url to select the background image location

  adding padding in the body tag style will make a border for all the page .

  The clip-path CSS property creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.
